    <h3>BYOB!</h3>
    <p>
      That's right, The G Spot is a BYOB bar. If we don't have the beer or drink you like, feel free to bring your own to the party. Coolers are welcome if you donâ€™t want to fight for fridge space.

    <h3>Full Bar</h3>
    <p>
      Along with being BYOB, The G Spot has a full bar as well. We have beers on tap and a decent inventory of booze with mixers available. Check out our current inventory listed below.

        This is a <strong>cash only</strong> establishment.  If you run out of cash, you can probably sweet talk the bartender into some free drinks.
