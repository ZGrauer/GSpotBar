        "description":"Doppelbock is a rich and malty, smooth full-bodied amber Doppelbock lage with flavors of caramel, molasses, and toasted bread. Decoction is a way of raising the temperature of the mash through boiling, without adding additional water or applying heat to the mash tun. For this batch of Doppelbock the brewers used under-modified malts, which are better suited for decoction mashing, and require additional brewing time. They used these malts not only to pay tribute to the old-style method of German brewing, but to add a smoother, maltier mouthfeel and depth of flavor.",
