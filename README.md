# The G Spot Bar
----

## What is it?
A responsive Single Page Application (SPA), written in [Angular v5.2](https://angular.io/), for a home bar. The G Spot website displays a reference of karaoke songs, beer, and drinks availible. It also has a contact form to email the bar owners.

All of this data for beer, booze, and karaoke songs are stored in JSON files in ./assets/JSON/.  Updating these files updates the website.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). The HTML/CSS templates utilize [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version 3.3.7 for styling.  The frontend uses [PrimeNG](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/) as an added UI framework.

## <a name="background"></a>Background

The G Spot is the name of my home bar, which was completed in 2017. It got it's name from my wife and I's last names.  The website was setup partially as a joke, but also as a reference.  The website can be used to find karaoke track #s from your phone.  It can also be used by friends to see what drinks are avialiable before coming over.

## <a name="dev"></a>Development Environment

Run `ng serve` in a terminal from the project directory for a dev server. The app can then be run by navigating to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```Shell
    $ ng serve
```

### <a name="cli">Code scaffolding

From a terminal run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component using the Angular CLI. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

    $ ng generate component component-name
```

## <a name="prod"></a>Production

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod --aot` flag for a production build.

```Shell
    $ ng build
```


## <a name="unittest">Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
